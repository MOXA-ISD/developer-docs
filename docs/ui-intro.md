## How to Develop?

ThingsPro provides two different ways to build web UI for your own application.

1. Use ThingsPro app UI starter
2. Create your own Web UI from scratch

## Getting Started with App UI starter

We have created an starter repository that will get all of the infrastructure set up for you to get your application up and running quickly.

### Prepare Development Environment

1. Ensure you have the latest version of Node installed.

   > You have to be on Node >= 8.x

2. Install [Angular Console Utility](https://angularconsole.com/#download) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
3. Open terminal and change directory path to starter project and run `npm install` to install modules of starter dependencies
